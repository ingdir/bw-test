# BrandWatch TagCloud

## Build and run

You have two options to see the result:

### On the Web

[Click here](http://rawgit.com/ingdir/bw-test/master/release/index.html) to see the page (this link uses `rawgit.com`)

### Run locally

To open the project locally, do the following:

  * Run `npm install` to get all modules
  * Optionally: `npm run build` to rebuild all files (but there's a copy in the repo)
  * Run a local HTTP server and set the `/release` folder as root
  * Open `index.html` to see the tag cloud
  * Resize the browser window and see the tags rearranged
  * Open `tests.html` for unit tests, or click the *Run tests* link at the bottom of the default page
